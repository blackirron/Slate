# Transparent Digital Slate Prototype

A framework for a boundary-circuit slate using IR touch technology and Python.

## Hardware Requirements
1. **The Slate:** A sheet of 5mm Tempered Glass or Acrylic.
2. **The Sensors:** An IR Touch Frame (USB HID compliant). These frames fit around the edges of the glass.
3. **The Display (Optional):** If you want to see what you write *on* the glass, you will need a short-throw projector hitting the back of the glass (coated with rear-projection film).

## Software Setup
1. Install Python 3.x
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install pygame
